                <h2>Gulshan Sariyeva</h2>
                <p>I am 19 years old third year IT student at ADA University. 
                    I am a multifaceted individual, balancing a range of professional, academic, and creative pursuits.
                     As the head of HR at the Watchmen Organization and a member of the ADA Watchmen community, I demonstrate strong leadership and organizational skills. 
                     My involvement as a volunteer in major events such as Formula 1, DevFest, and Frontiers of AI reflects my commitment to personal growth and community engagement. 
                     As a student success coach, I focus on empowering others by sharing knowledge, offering guidance, and supporting them in overcoming challenges to achieve their goals. 
                    I value collaboration and believe that diverse perspectives are the cornerstone of innovation and growth.

                <h2>Leyla Safarova</h2>
                <p>I am a 17-year-old first-year Computer Science student driven by a passion for technology and the endless possibilities it offers. The ever-evolving world of innovation inspired me to dive into this field, where curiosity meets creation. Outside the classroom, I find joy in reading, a gateway to exploring new ideas and perspectives that challenge my thinking.
                    My love for motorsports, particularly Formula 1, has been a constant source of excitement and inspiration. This year, I turned that passion into action by volunteering at an F1 event, immersing myself in its fast-paced and exhilarating environment. Beyond F1, I’ve dedicated my time to volunteering with diverse organizations, from contributing to ecological projects at the Ministry of Ecology to supporting animal shelters.
                    I thrive on variety, and my ability to communicate in four languages, alongside Azerbaijani, reflects my eagerness to connect with people and cultures.

                    Earning my place at ADA through my SAT and TOEFL scores was a proud moment for me, and I’m passionate about diving into the dynamic world of technology. Outside my studies, I have a curious mind that loves exploring new things, especially through the internet. Whether it’s discovering innovative ideas, learning unique skills, or understanding global trends, this hobby fuels my creativity and keeps me motivated.

                <h2>Yaqub Samadzade</h2>
                <p>I am 18 years old and currently a student of Electronics and Electrical Engineering at ADA University. 
                    This year marks my first year in the General Education program, where I am building a strong academic foundation for my future studies in engineering. 
                    Before this, I successfully completed the EAPP Foundation Year at ADA, which helped me improve my academic and language skills, preparing me for the challenges of university life.
                    My journey to ADA University began with my achievement in the State Exam (DİM), which secured my place at this prestigious institution.
                    Beyond academics, I have a strong passion for football. While I may not excel as a player, I have a deep appreciation for the sport and have been actively involved in many football competitions as a volunteer. 
                    These experiences have taught me the value of teamwork, dedication, and community involvement, all of which I aim to carry into my academic and professional endeavors. </p>
