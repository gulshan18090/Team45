            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 5, 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Baku Secondary School No.5 in Mehdiabad</p>

                <p>Despite difficulties in finding a suitable community and some technical difficulties, we successfully created interest among children.<br>
                    Gulshan Sariyeva started by introducing ADA University, highlighting its academic achievements and best student admissions this year. We also presented a YouTube campus tour video explaining the different university buildings.<br>
                    Each team member talked about their department and career advantages. While Yagub Samadzada emphasized the increasing importance of electronics and electrical engineering, Dilara Misirkhanli discussed the admission requirements of ADA, including SAT. During the speech of these 3 people Leyla Safarova was taking pictures and videos.<br>
                    Since there was no computer room, we introduced Code org to the children using our own devices and explained its basic elements. Many showed interest in returning to the site to explore more coding exercises, and we explained that “code” in this context means programming, not a “password”.<br>
                    The session was well received, and we were pleased to see some students inspired to learn more about coding. This experience strengthened our teamwork and helped us share our valuable knowledge with younger students.
